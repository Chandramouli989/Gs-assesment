# GovernSafe React JS Assessment

## Project Overview

This is a React JS implementation of the animated UI shown in the provided `onboarding.gif`. The goal was to replicate the animation and layout using **React functional components**, **Framer Motion** for animations, and **Styled Components** for styling.

## What I Implemented

- **Responsive Card Layout**: Centralized onboarding card with a modern, clean UI.
- **Animated Rotating Ring**: Created a circular animation using `@keyframes` to simulate the gif.
- **Inner Welcome Circle**: Positioned centrally with shadow and text, matching the original design.
- **Action Buttons**: Two styled buttons with hover effects to interact with the user.
- **Smooth Animation**: Used Framer Motion and CSS to create fluid transitions.
- **Styled-Components**: For modular, reusable styling with scoped components.
- **Mobile Friendly Design**: Layout adjusts for smaller screens as well.
